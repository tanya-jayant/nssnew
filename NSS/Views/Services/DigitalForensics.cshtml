                Just as in the physical world, we leave traces of ourselves – fingerprints, hairs, clothing fibers, DNA, etc. – when we move and interact with people, places, and objects, so too do activities in the digital realm leave pieces or echoes of themselves. These digital traces – think file fragments, activity logs, timestamps, metadata, and so on – may be deemed to be of value, for any number of reasons.

            <p style="text-align:justify">Nearly all “white collar” crimes today involve the computer either as a tool in enabling the crime or as a target of the crime. NSS provides expertise in Digital Forensics with high level of security consciousness. </p>
            <p style="text-align:justify">
                NSS was one of the first companies in India to provide computer forensics services to corporate entities as well as law enforcement. The demand for investigative services mushroomed in the first decade of this century as computing power went into overdrive. Investigations into IP theft, running of parallel counterfeiting operations, anonymous mails, email spoofing, IP spoofing have become par for the course. Analysing intrusions and the nature of information lost over time, gave corporate entities a good measure of their weak protective systems and provided them a basis to invest intelligently in securing their digital assets.
