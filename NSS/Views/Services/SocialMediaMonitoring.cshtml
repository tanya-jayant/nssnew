                According to Forbes, there are 4.02 billion internet users around the globe — that’s 53% of the world’s total population. Active social media users make up 42% of the population. This alone proves that social media is here to stay, if not to flourish further.
                <br />
                As consumers spend more time on social media, the platforms also become the go-to source for product and brand information. With more than 60 million Facebook Pages, brands are reaching millions on the social media platform. One-fifth of the world’s population makes online purchases and pays their bills online.
                Interestingly, because the highest percentage of users — ages 18 to 34 years old — has the most buying power, they’re likely to make a purchase with the influence of social media.

                The internet has become a powerful platform on which more than half the world today participates. Businesses are enabled, social interactions have burgeoned, and the mammoth value of whole new e-businesses is shaped on what the world is discussing and viewing on the internet.
                Views, comments and off-the-cuff remarks by people are digital footprints on the internet and can be traced back to the originators. This may have a reputational impact on the individual or his/her organisation and its brand value.
