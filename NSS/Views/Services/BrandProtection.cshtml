                Brand is often the most valuable asset for any business. A good brand name distinguishes the organization from its competitors. Failure to take measures to protect the brand could diminish the value and disrupt the reputation of the organization.
                <br />
                In addition:
                <br />
                1. Prevents unnecessary expenditures: A counterfeit product could cost the organization huge sums of money for litigation procedures.
                <br />
                2. Rebranding: Without adequate brand protection, counterfeits can take over the market. This could hamper business recognition and reputation. Therefore, a situation could arise wherein rebranding is done to create a new identity. This would again cost the company and it gives no guarantee that the company will regain its previous position in the market.
