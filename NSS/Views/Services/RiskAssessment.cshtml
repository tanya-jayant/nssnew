                Every day, businesses are confronted with disasters of varying degrees.  Business owners should take steps to protect their business or brand. Without a periodic risk assessment and a business continuity plan, one in four businesses are forced to shut down because of a disaster.

            <h3>Physical Risk Assessment</h3>
            <p style="text-align:justify">
                A good Risk Assessment will help to prevent accidents and ill health. These not only have the potential to ruin lives, but they could also increase costs to businesses through lost output, compensation claims and higher insurance premiums.
                <br />
                The general steps to take are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Identify hazards.</li>
                    <li>Analyse the affected areas.</li>
                    <li>Evaluate the risks and consider controls.</li>
                    <li>Record the findings and implement them.</li>
                    <li>Are reasonably practicable control measures in place?</li>
                    <li>Review your risk assessment every year.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:justify">
                NSS helps define the controls in place to reduce exposure and evaluate the costs. <br />
                We assess and analyse the threats due to natural circumstances, supply systems, political situations and human errors and accidents. We will conduct compliance assessments against standards, regulations and contractual obligations to help secure and safeguard you personnel, assets and business.

            <h3>Business Continuity Planning</h3>
            <p style="text-align:justify">
                Business continuity planning is vital. It’s important to devote enough time and attention to planning for the future, even when that future may involve events that are unpleasant to think about and, hopefully, not likely to happen.
              
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:justify">
                A lot of the present day’s vital assets are online and must be accessible at all times. Businesses contend with both operational failure and reputational risk, and how they respond to a discontinuity is a measure of the value of the business.
                Sound BCP is based on an accurate and updated business impact assessment, from which derives the essence of a continuity plan – what is critical to protect and keep operational, how to respond to interruptions, protect personnel and assets, safeguard information from destruction and wrongful use, when to relocate critical operations to alternate sites.
