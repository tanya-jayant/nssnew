                In our unpredictable world, the flap of a butterfly's wing in some location can set off a cascade of events that, weeks later, spurs the formation of a hurricane in a completely different part of the world.
                <br />
                Across industries, employers are aware of the significance of having a robust and utilized hazard observation and incident reporting system. Global businesses with international travellers assure personnel safety in different time zones, coordinating and tracking personnel movement and rendering alerts and advisories where required.
                <br />
                <b>The goal is to alert the company management on sources of potential health, safety and process risk, and to effectively direct the risk management approach.</b>
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:justify">
                The exact predictive power of safety incidents or near misses on future safety events is complex and not always positive (e.g. minor incidents may not predict major incidents or fatalities and focussing on near misses may not reduce accident frequency). Nonetheless, the use of such reporting and analysis mechanisms may be important for developing a sound culture of safety, for averting large-scale industrial disasters, and may also be important for proactively meeting legal duties.
                <br />
                A good way to prepare is to be backed up by professionals who can connect the dots and unravel the pattern.
